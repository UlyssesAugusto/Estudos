## Python

Python:
- infer types
- is loosely typed
- works with identation and :
- strings are called str

Import `from cs50 import get_string`

For loop
```python
for i in range(3)
  print("hello")
```

Functions
```python
def load(params):
  print(params)
```

There's always a price to pay when changing something into computer science

Computer program always come with tradeoffs. Being a programmer is know what tools to use for the trade.

Interpreter languages always need to "translate" the code, that means more time, because we not compile code itself, we just write and a program (interpreter) translate to us.

```python
for something in other

if x in z #for with if
```

Dictionaries are really fast in Python, they use hashtables under the hood to get the better iterate time
